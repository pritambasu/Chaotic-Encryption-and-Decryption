# Chaotic-Encryption-and-Decryption

Information security has become a major issue during the last decades where new algorithms based on algebraic methods or chaotic dynamics were suggested for encryption. In this project, the encryption technique includes two main operations, permutation at pixel level and masking and permutation at bit level. Simulations show that the proposed encryption technique is effective and has a high-level security.
This code is done in python and visualized in jupyter notebook. The code uses Open CV, PIL and Numpy libraries to perform a lossless chaotic encryption.
